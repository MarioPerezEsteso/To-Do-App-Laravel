# To-Do App Laravel

This web application has been developed in order to teach how to use Laravel 5. If you want to follow a tutorial in spanish that teaches you how to develop this code, I invite you to visit [Geeky Theory](https://goo.gl/7TgyZ0).

The code is in the dev branch, so if you want to follow the tutorial, you can start from scratch in the master branch.
